#### Key Points
- R (Requirements): requirements and use case diagrams
- F (Functions): represented with internal block diagram (black-box model: function-flow)
- Be (Expected behaviour): activity, sequence and statemachine diagrams
- Bs (Behaviour of the system): parametric and same diagrams as Be
- GS (Generic Structure): class diagram (with abstract
classes)
- S (Structure): class, components and deployment diagrams
